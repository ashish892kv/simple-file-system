Key Features:
* File Operations:
    * Create a new file.
    * Delete a file.
    * Read from a file.
    * Write to a file.
    * Append to a file.
* Directory Management:
    * Create a new directory.
    * Delete a directory.
    * List contents of a directory.
* File Permissions:
    * Implement basic file permissions (read, write, execute) for users.
* Error Handling:
    * Implement error handling for various scenarios (e.g., file not found, insufficient permissions).
* User Interface:
    * Create a simple command-line interface for interacting with the file system.
* Persistence:
    * Implement a simple mechanism for persisting the file system state. This can involve saving the file system structure and content to a file and loading it on startup.
* Concurrency:
    * If you want to add an extra challenge, consider implementing basic concurrency control to handle multiple users/processes accessing the file system simultaneously.
Steps to Implement:
* Design:
    * Start by designing the structure of your file system. Think about how you'll represent files, directories, and permissions.
* Data Structures:
    * Implement the necessary data structures for the file system, such as structures for files, directories, and user permissions.
* File System Operations:
    * Begin by implementing the basic file operations like creating, deleting, reading, and writing files.
* Directory Management:
    * Add functionality for managing directories, including creating and deleting directories and listing their contents.
* Permissions:
    * Incorporate basic file permissions into your file system.
* User Interface:
    * Create a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the file system.
* Persistence:
    * Implement mechanisms to save and load the file system state.
* Concurrency (Optional):
    * If you're up for a challenge, add basic concurrency control to your file system.
Resources:
* C Programming:
    * Make sure you are comfortable with C programming, especially file I/O operations.
* Operating Systems Concepts:
    * Understand basic concepts of operating systems, file systems, and permissions.
* Data Structures:
    * Familiarize yourself with data structures like linked lists and trees.
* Command Line Interface (CLI) Design:
    * Learn about designing simple command-line interfaces.
